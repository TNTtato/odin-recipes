# odin-recipes
In this project I going to apply what I've learned so far in the HTML basics of the Odin Project Curriculum
the project consist in adding three recipies in an index.html file. Each recipe must have three parts, Description, Ingredients and Steps.
All of the html files of the recipes have a img related to that recipe
