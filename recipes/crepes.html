    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li> 2 eggs</li>
        <li> ½ cup milk</li>
        <li> ½ cup water</li>
        <li> ¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
        <li>Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
